# MiniProject-AEC
Analog Electronic circuits mini project for year 2 semester 2.

## TEMPERATURE SENSOR WITH VCO OUTPUT RELAY DRIVER
This is a report on the construction of a temperature sensor with a VCO output, which was created as part of a mini project in the Analogue Electronic Circuits module for semester two if the Internet of Things.

A handy app was used called Fritzing http://fritzing.org/home/ to plan everything out roughly to some accuracy before actually getting stuck into it. Had a lot of fun and learnt a good amount regarding circuitry in general!
