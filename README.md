# MiniProject-AEC
Analog Electronic circuits mini project for year 2 semester 2.

## TEMPERATURE SENSOR WITH VCO OUTPUT RELAY DRIVER
This is a report on the construction of a temperature sensor with a VCO output, which was created as part of a mini project in the Analogue Electronic Circuits module for semester two if the Internet of Things.

A handy app was used called Fritzing http://fritzing.org/home/ to plan everything out roughly to some accuracy before actually getting stuck into it. The Fritzing .zz file is also included if you would like to see it through the app. Overall, I certainly enjoyed the experience and learnt a good amount regarding circuitry in general!
